# Modifications to the book
The html markup has been modified in order to be used in the EPub format.
The css stylesheet has been replaced.
These modifications should not alter the content, but will affect presentation.

Tables of Content have been added according to the EPub file format.

# Notes
MathML has not been used on purpose as some EPub reading devices do not support MathML and provide illegible equations.
So far some symbols have been replaced by unicode charactes, displayed equation remain in the image format of the original source.
